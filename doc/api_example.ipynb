For example : if you want to move unit 6 from hex 1,2 to hex 1,5, you need to write three move orders IN THE CORRECT ORDER FOR THE SAME UNIT : \"6 move to 1,3\" then \"6 move to 1,4\" then \"6 move to 1,5\" and those must be IN THE CORRECT ORDER in the pending_orders list, since we execute orders in a FIFO fashion\n",
