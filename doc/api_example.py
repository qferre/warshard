# TODO : write EXPLICITLY that you may (and indeed should), instead of calling directly run_a_turn, LOOK INTO THE SOURCE CODE OF RUN_A_TURN AND CALL EACH FUNCTION THAT RUNS A PHASE INDIVIDUALLY. Indeed, these functions have been designed to be run like this, separately : run_a_turn does little more than simply call each function in order !
# This means we can run phase and let orders be adjusted by the agent depending on, for example, fights declared.

# There are also functions that give individual orders (ie. start a fight here, etc.) so the simulation can be run with granulatiry in  a notebook, as if we were playing, and not just entire phase by entire phase. Although for me this is not as critical since all events of an entire phase are supposed to execute simultaneously and without input of the opponent (--> in the rules you make all your attacker declarations before the opponent gets an opportunity to make defender support declarations)
# Look at the python file of the tests for examples of this
