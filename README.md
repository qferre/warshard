# WarShard
A simplified modern wargame designed to be compatible with training AIs, thanks to an API





Remember to make this repository public once done !

Current code on my 17pouces, currently open on my vscode






Draw units and the rest for all this ;)
Ask jeanne to help with a quick test of the rules, then start coding it

Say it's based on SPI wargames ?


Rules are in ![hello](./doc/rules.md)




## Installation

to install : in a terminal at the root of the project, run `pip install .`


## API

See api_example

General principle is that you should ask you AI agent to produce putative orders, then pass the list of those orders to the simulation
to see the results of those orders
